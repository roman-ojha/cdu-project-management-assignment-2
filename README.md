# HIT137 Assignment 2

This repository contains the solutions for HIT137 Assignment 2. The assignment is divided into three questions, each implemented in its respective folder. Below is a summary of the tasks and instructions to run the programs.

## Question 1: Text Encryption and Decryption
- **Description**: Implements a double-shift encryption and decryption mechanism.
- **Files**:
  - `main.py`: Contains the encryption and decryption logic.
  - `raw_text.txt`: Input text to be encrypted.
  - `encrypted_text.txt`: Stores the encrypted text.
  - `decrypted_text.txt`: Stores the decrypted text.
  - `shifts.txt`: Stores the shifts used for encryption.
  - `terminal output.png`: Show the terminal output.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Navigate to the `question-1` folder.
  2. Run the program: `python3 main.py`.
  3. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt text.

## Question 2: Temperature Data Analysis
- **Description**: Analyzes temperature data to compute seasonal averages, the station with the largest temperature range, and temperature stability.
- **Files**:
  - `main.py`: Contains the data processing and analysis logic.
  - `temperatures/`: Folder containing temperature data files.
  - `average_temp.txt`: Stores seasonal average temperatures.
  - `largest_temp_range_station.txt`: Stores the station with the largest temperature range.
  - `temperature_stability_stations.txt`: Stores the most stable and most variable stations.
  - `terminal output.png`: Show the terminal output.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Navigate to the `question-2` folder.
  2. Ensure the `temperatures/` folder contains the required CSV files.
  3. Run the program: `python3 main.py`.

## Question 3: Recursive Pattern Drawing
- **Description**: Draws recursive patterns using the Turtle graphics library.
- **Files**:
  - `main.py`: Contains the recursive drawing logic.
  - `terminal output.png`: Show the terminal output.
  - `output.png`: Show the recursive patterns output.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Navigate to the `question-3` folder.
  2. Run the program: `python3 main.py`.
  3. Follow the prompts to input the number of sides, side length, and recursion depth.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required libraries (e.g., `turtle`, `pandas`) installed. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
